Yo, I am Hal.
I do programming shit, but it is mostly nonserious and simply to fuck around. For example, I use lolcode, but purely for the funnyâ„¢.
I might do some actually good things in the future.
I really am into obscure things.
Yes, my account name is a reference to the band Tally Hall. Yes, my own name is a Homestuck & 2001: A Space Odyssey reference.
My pronouns are it/he, but i am also fond of neopronouns.
Boom.
